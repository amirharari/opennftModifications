# OpenNFT
OpenNFT is a GUI-based multi-processing open-source software package for real-time fMRI neurofeedback training and quality assessment.
This package is based on best practices of the platform-independent interpreted programming languages Python and Matlab to facilitate
concurrent functionality, high modularity, and the ability to extend the software in Python or Matlab depending on end-user preferences.
OpenNFT includes, but is not limited to, the functionality of SPM, PsychoPy and Psychtoolbox software suits. The OpenNFTâ€™s GUI,
synchronization module and multi-processing core are implemented in Python, whilst computational modules for real-time data processing
and neurofeedback are implemented in Matlab.
